Analyis of Iris Recognition

This repository explores iris recognition by putting classic algorithms to the test using nothing more than images snapped with an ordinary Camera.
This project explores an adapted version of John Daugmanâ€™s iris recognition algorithm [detailed here](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jgd1000/), alongside some classical image comparison methods, to see how well they can distinguish between matching and non-matching iris images.
